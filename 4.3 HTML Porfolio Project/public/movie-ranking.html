<h3>Avatar: The Way of the Water</h3>
<p>
  Rating: 9/10 <br />
  Released: 2022 <br />
  Review: This is the second movie in the series (next ones are coming 2025 and
  2029), but you don't need to watch the first movie, even though I really
  recomend it. Other than that, the animation is really good and overall CGI,
  especially since it takes place on another planet with completely new animals.

<h3>Minions: Rise of Gru</h3>
<p>
  Rating: 7/10 <br />
  Released: 2022 <br />
  Review: This movie is a prequel to Despicable Me and a sequel to Minions, so
  as usual, no additional information required if you know of Minion's
  existance. It's about the Minions and their owner, Gru while Gru was still a
  child. If you haven't watched any of the Despicable Me franchise beforehand
