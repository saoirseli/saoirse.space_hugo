Days ago, way back on the second Saturday of May, I did my first interview with my dance teacher Vincent. I recorded it down immediately after. Here is

Today I did my first interview, with my hip-hop dance teacher Vincent. It was much easier than I thought. I thought it might be awkward, and that I wouldn’t be able to connect the phrases together. I hadn’t prepared much, just the beginning and the questions. Dad bought coffee for him and brought it at the beginning, and I was starting to get nervous. I had thrown it to the back of my head for the week because I had prepared by questions on Sunday. I threw it to the back of my mind again, or I tried, but it kept popping up. The coffee sitting there and staring at me didn’t help.

Eventually, we came to the end of class. I was complaining, both in my head and a little out loud, that time had passed so painfully fast. Eventually, everyone left. Dad had already come and gave me the paper and phone. I started recording. Starting with a casual topic, I asked him about his schedule. He mentioned that he was going to be in a new show, Fray. After like, 20 seconds of explaining, I started with my intro, explaining why I wanted this interview in addition to entering in the competition for the Time for Kids. Then, I moved on with my questions. My first was about how he started dancing hip-hop. He was eating strawberries (It was around 12:40 and it was after dance class) and he mentioned that he was homeschooled because his family were pastors and traveled a lot, and he got inspired by a friend in the pastoring business, break-dancer Josh. And then we went through the list of questions, with me adding a few along the way to fit with the content and having some not so connecting connections. Eventually, I reached the end. I knew I should have prepared an ending. I was totally not too lazy to do that. And I ended it abruptly, asking him if he could film the dance that we were learning for me to practice. We did that every class but this one ended with us watching a video so we didn’t have time. Anyways, I went out to get my dad and I stopped the recording. I felt relief wash over me and pride. It wasn’t that hard after all! It was actually just like talking. Talking in a conversation, not like in a serious interview.
