# Egypt's First Pyramid

There was a model of a city constructed in Egypt five thousand years ago. Built dedicated to King Zoser, city for the dead, by the famous Imhotep. It still stands today! Underneath is a sideview of the model, as well as a description of the pyramid. Look at the dots in the courtyard! Each dot is a human!

# Alchemy

There was a whole gallery dedicated to Alchemy back then. In the image below, there are some of an alchemist’s legendary ingredients. The ones with lines are the ones I will name. The first one (left to right) is gold in the veins of quartz. The second is bar of pure gold (a very thin one). The third is a model of the legendary philosopher’s stone. It is blood red, transparent, and glass-like. Supposedly, it is heavier than gold, soluble in any liquid, and incombustible to fire. It can turn base metals into precious ones, and make you immortal, as any Harry Potter fan should know (and isn’t everyone one?). The fourth ones are elixirs. The white is supposed to prolong life, and the red (I’m afraid is not visible from the angle) is supposed to give you projection powers. And the last one is questionable. It is likely tonic, though I don’t know much about them.

# Garden and Cool Models

Posted below are some images of the garden and some cool models. See you in the next post!
