Just so you know, I changed the first post into just a general vacations section, which you can find, along with the rest of the series that I'm going to develop, in the vacation accounts section! A few days ago, I went to the AAH Volunteer Orientation!

# What it Is

So the AAH stands for Animal Assisted Happiness. Their mission is to help youths with need by either driving the animals over the family's homes or through visit to their farm. They goal is to get to a million 'smiles that only animals can bring.' So far, they have delivered 79,110. Wowza! They also seek to hire more youth volunteers and involve them in animals. All of this is funded by donations and grants. Located in Baylands Park, Sunnyvale, they have a very friendly environment!

# The Orientation

Our Orientation began when we signed in via the volunteer sheet, at 10:30. The founder, Vicki Amon-Higa, and her son, Johnathon Amon, as well as 2 Youth Volunteers, led us to the entrance. There was a small bridge, accept with no gap underneath, and a beatiful border. We toured the place, and I went was selected to go into the
dove area. ALl of the animals were so soft! I learned how to hold a chicken, as well as felt small goats. I never knew there were Pygmy Goats, like the Pygmy Puffs in Harry Potter! i wonder if Rowling got the idea from that the Pygmy goat type! Most of the things were apparently scout made, and the bunny exhibition was the favorite and most crowded exhibition. We also met a tortoise, as well as alpacas!!!!, mini horses, and pigs. A mini Donkey accompanied the mini horses, and even though he was obese, they let him be as happy as they wanted.

The one leading the procession mentioned that when us kids were older, they could become Youth Volunteers. And apparently, they do excellent letters of recommendation. I wanna become one someday!
