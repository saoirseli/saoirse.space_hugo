It was my first time doing AAH (Animal Assisted Happiness) during the open house hours (AKA the public coming in but not coming inside the enclosures)

# Open House

Like I mentioned, Open House hours is basically just when we have the public come one into the farm. They can reach through the fence to let the animals smell them, and sometimes, in the case of guinea pigs and rabbits, they can (I think) take them out. I have never visited the chickens or ducks, but I think you can go in their pens. not for the horses, big goats, or small goats though. Those are the enclosures, all of the ones I've just mentioned, with volunteers in them. Oh! And of course, the birds: doves and such. I'm not sure about their restrictions. I don't think volunteers are usually allowed in the pig pen, (I'm not sure) and definitely not for the tortoise. I got sorted into the small goat pen. My job was basically just to introduce the goats to the public and tell them about the goats. Dad said it was like being an advertising saleswoman. He didn't advertise a lot though.

Most of the kids were little, and many were a little scared. Most of the time I was talking to their parents and they relayed the info to their kids.

# GOATS!

Surprisingly, the mini goats were better than I had expected. They were small and so cute, and though they weren't as soft as some, they were cute. The best business hours was during around 10:30 AM to 11:15. My hours are from 10 am to 12. Oddly enough, they barely used their playground. THey just lay in the shade. I sorta wanted to use their playground for them. I mean, who wouldn't want swings and walk on platforms connected by slightly thick ramps going up. It was quite high though. (IMAGE to be posted) Since it was my first time at the goats, I had to memorize all their names. Dad took pictures of their names, there were wooden tags with their names on it outside the enclosure. I mainly spent my time explaining to people the goat's names, how we identified them from each other, and such. And told them that they don't bite. I remember that once a mature lady asked me where the bathroom was. It was a porta-potty that they were building a wall around. Eww! I remember one of the goats, Forest or Finn, I don't remember. They're brothers and the only difference is their ear colors. Forest has white ears while Finn has dark ones. I made the mistake of telling a lot of people they were mates because they were wearing purple felt collars instead of the usual pink for girl blue for boy chain collars. :( We mixed up Romeo for Chewy, who was the one that would turn his head around if you petted him. Romeo was the friendly one. The second senesitive one was Jet. He was basically black. The rest were quite friendly. Finn and Forest were the friendliest. They loved my squishball.

The goat here is Finn, and I'm holding my orangish pinkish squishball

It was DIY and was basically a balloon with water and beads in it, but whatever.They loved to smell it, and at first, they followed the ball around and looked up whenever I squished it and a bulge came out. Later, they were too tired though. A lot of kids fed the goats. They have a special diet. Also not a petting zoo.
