Starting from wednesday, I had surfing camp.

<!--more-->

# 1st Day

I went with another kid, Sophie (carpool). On the first day, we arrive quite early, and was in time to be able to play for a while on the beach. My feet got numb. Then, we joined in with the rest of the camp, and we spent a long time talking about safety, surfing ettiquete etc.

Finally we got into the water. We mainly just hopped and tried to walk out surfboards further out. There were three instructors. David, who seemed to be the oldest and the one that was in charge, a young man, and a young lady (who was only 13? 15? I'm not sure but she was barely taller than I was). David and the man got further and eventually onto our boards so we could catch waves instead of just bobbing (The girl didn't do much but keep us organized) the other man helped me for the first three times I got on, and the first time I was successful, meaning I didn't fall, the second time I fell and the board fell on me, the third time, same thing. I finally got David to help me, and that time, I was able to go on my knees for a while! (before the board fell on top of me yet again, not as long though)\

# 2nd Day

I actually got to stand that day. So sad that I didn't get that videoed. Anyways, we spent much of the time playing in the water, kinda sad. I wish I had made the decision to surf a little longer. it was still quite fun though. Hmm.

# 3rd day

Yesterday was the last and final day, we spent most of the time surfing, playing in the water a little at the beginning and a little at the end (30 min at the end) I got to kneel, and I rode successfully once on my stomach, and once I fell in the water. After class, we (me and sophie) played a while more, mostly burying our feel and looking for sea crabs. We played a little while sitting in the water, then we undressed and got panda express!
I got white rice with orange chicken and broccile beaf, while she got the same but wiht chao mien. We mixed the write rice and chao mien a little. Yesterday was bliss!

# Oofs

We had a lot of times where we got blown back and the waves blew our boards so they turned. It was sad. the waves hurt. I don't like getting underwater. It stings. imagine if we were swimming in the dead sea.
