Last week was sure fun visiting Great America during it's Winterfest event!

# Christmas Tree Lighting

The image above was of before the tree lights up, and included below is an image of afterwards. I have to say, it was impressive. The daily Lighting Ceremony is at 5:30 each day, and, if you're visiting California's Great America, don't miss it!

# Ice Skating

Every time, during the Winterfest season, Great America would turn its pond into an ice skating rink. When entering, go to the right, and you'll find the booth where they are renting ice skates. You can ask for all-day, or hourly, I think. Last time we went, which was on the 20th, my dad had to carry the skates around in a backpack when we stopped skating the first time for the lighting ceremony, mentioned above. There are these small, red, low sticks for holding, and they can go fast, but there are also, bigger, bulkier, red / blue things, sort of like stands, which one can push around, though it's slower.
