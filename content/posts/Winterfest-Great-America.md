# Christmas Tree Lighting

The image above was of before the tree lights up, and included below is an image of afterwards. I have to say, it was impressive. The daily Lighting Ceremony is at 5:30 each day, and, if you're visiting California's Great America, don't miss it!

# Ice Skating

Every time, during the Winterfest season, Great America would turn its pond into an ice skating rink. When entering, go to the right, and you'll find the booth where they are renting ice skates. You can ask for all-day, or hourly, I think. Last time we went, which was on the 20th, my dad had to carry the skates around in a backpack when we stopped skating the first time for the lighting ceremony, mentioned above. There are these small, red, low sticks for holding, and they can go fast, but there are also, bigger, bulkier, red / blue things, sort of like stands, which one can push around, though it's slower, or as many people prefer, just skating without help.

# Let It Snow

Every 15 min, as well as after the Tree Lighting Ceremoney or the performance of Cool Yule Christmas, in the Celebration Plaza, snow will fall from the sky. It's a wonder how they have snow falling from the sky, while everything goes on.

# Decorating Cookies with Mrs. Claus

Who doesn't love cookies? Go to Orleans Place, at the left of the entrance, and go to Peppermint Patty's Candy Shop! There, you can decorate four large sugar cookies to take home, with frosting and all kinds of toppings. Anyone is welcome there, though it costs around $19, plus applicable fees.

# Check out more by going there!

That's only a tidbit of all of California's Great America's wonders. Check out more by actually going there! Reminder: Winterfest lasts from Novemeber 26 - January 9, so be sur to plan your visit for Winterfest on one of these days!
